### Do People Have the Power to Choose?

For example, during the extreme lockdown in Shanghai, I was required to undergo pointless nucleic acid tests. Did I have the power to choose? It didn’t seem like it.

But if you think about it, I actually chose to obey, lining up like a **zombie** for the tests. But why did I choose to obey? Because I had a deeper choice—I chose to give up my immediate freedom to gain long-term freedom, essentially abandoning the first half of my life for a future freedom.

Some people chose more drastic measures; they resist, they refuse to have children, they commit suicide!

So among these lines of zombie-like crowds, there are noble souls. Beneath their wooden exterior lies a volcano ready to erupt at any moment.

I am moved to tears by the nobility of some people's souls.

Did you see? Even in a hopeless situation, people still have the power to choose.

God gave humans souls and free will, not for us to eat only rice. My actions define my existence.

### 人有选择的权力吗？

比如我在上海经历极端封控，我被要求必须做那毫无意义的核酸检测。我有选择的权力吗？看起来没有。

但如果你再想想呢？其实是我选择了服从，像僵尸一样排着队做核酸。可是我为什么选择了服从呢？因为我有更深远的选择，我要抛弃我的前半生，我选择放弃眼前的自由，争取长远的自由。

也有人选择了更决绝的方式，他们反抗，他们不生孩子，他们自杀！

所以在这一排排僵尸一样的人群中，不乏高贵的灵魂。在他们木讷的外表下，是随时准备爆发的活火山。

看到了吧？在绝望的环境下，人任然有选择的权力。
我要流泪了。感动于有些人灵魂的高贵。

上帝赋予人类灵魂和自由意志，不是让我们只吃米的。

所以人有选择的权力吗？有，绝对有！
