# Portfolio

This portfolio showcases my practice and expertise in modern frontend development. Currently, it focuses on pure frontend development. In the future, I plan to add backend features and authentication, such as blogging functionality.

I prefer to use Next.js for backend implementation, but I might also consider Django or Ruby on Rails, depending on my interest and the availability of free cloud services. However, I will not use Java. Let's see how it evolves.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Libraries Used

### [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

### [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
