# My Origins and Purpose

I come from **Shanghai**. Experiencing the extreme lockdowns of 2022 gave me a new understanding of freedom and dignity. I spent 30 years from birth to becoming aware of the world, and another 13 years grasping the essence of modern civilization.

I am deeply grateful to the **Canadian people** and government for their commitment to diversity and inclusiveness, which allows me to share and uphold these same values and way of life. I am dedicated to working hard, being self-sufficient, and contributing to the community in return for the opportunity to live here.

I know where I come from, why I am here, and what I should do and enjoy. I will never forget this journey!
